I happened to use [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) a lot in the last few months, so I decided to write down a couple tips which could be useful to those who are already a bit familiar with the framework. For those who are not, pytest [documentation](https://pytest.org/latest/index.html) is a good place where to start.

### Parametrized dictionary

njksanjsdnajknsa

### Mock yield

njksdnjnandn,na

### Mock decorator last

njklsnlsnklns

### Combine fixtures

msklanslkmkla

I might add more tips to the list as time goes by in case I find anyhting useful and general enough.
